Documentation for FreeFlux
==========================

FreeFlux is a Python package for \ :sup:`13`\C metabolic flux analysis (\ :sup:`13`\C MFA) of biological systems at isotopic steady state or isotopically nonstationary state (INST) state. Functionally, FreeFlux is capable of:

- metabolic flux estimation
- simulation of labeling patterns of metabolite (fragments)
- constraint-based optimizations, such as flux balance analysis (FBA) and flux variability analysis (FVA)
