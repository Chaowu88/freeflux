MDV
===

Mass isotopomer distribution vector (MDV) represents the molar fractions of isotopomers of a metabolite (fragment). It is the fundamental input for \ :sup:`13`\metabolic flux analysis after correction for natural abundance of isotopes. FreeFlux provides class ``MDV`` for basic operations of MDVs.
