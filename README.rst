FreeFlux
========

FreeFlux is a Python package for :sup:`13`\ C metabolic flux analysis of biological systems at isotopic steady state or transient state which thus can be used for both heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms. The fundamental functions provided by FreeFlux include:
 - metabolic flux estimation
 - simulation of labeling patterns of metabolite (fragments)
 - constraint-based optimization, such as flux balance analysis and flux variability analysis
