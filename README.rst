FreeFlux
========

FreeFlux is a Python package for :sup:`13`\ C metabolic flux analysis of biological systems at isotopic steady state or transient state which thus can be used for both heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms. Aiming to benefit the accessibility of :sup:`13`\ C fluxomics for researchers in the community of metabolic phenotyping and engineering, FreeFlux provide the fundamental functions include:

- metabolic flux estimation
- simulation of labeling patterns of metabolite (fragments)
- constraint-based optimization, such as flux balance analysis and flux variability analysis
