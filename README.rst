FreeFlux
========

FreeFlux is a Python package for :sup:`13`\ C metabolic flux analysis of biological systems at isotopic steady state or transient state which thus can be used for both heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms. The fundamental functions provided by FreeFlux include:

- metabolic flux estimation
- simulation of labeling patterns of metabolite (fragments)
- constraint-based optimizations, such as flux balance analysis and flux variability analysis

The aim is to benefit the accessibility of :sup:`13`\ C fluxomics technique for researchers in the community of metabolic phenotyping and engineering.
