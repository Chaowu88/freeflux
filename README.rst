FreeFlux
========

FreeFlux is a Python package for :sup:`13`\ C metabolic flux analysis of biological systems at isotopic steady state or transient state which thus can be used for both heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms. Functionally, FreeFlux is capable of:

- metabolic flux estimation
- simulation of labeling patterns of metabolite (fragments)
- constraint-based optimizations, such as flux balance analysis and flux variability analysis

The aim is to benefit the accessibility of :sup:`13`\ C fluxomics technique for researchers in the community of metabolic phenotyping and engineering.

A documentation can be found `here <https://freeflux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. The documentation illustrates the fundamental functions of FreeFlux with a `toy model <https://github.com/Chaowu88/freeflux/tree/main/models/toy>`_. Two practical models of |text|_
